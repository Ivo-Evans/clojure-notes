Lein is the most common Clojure build tool, very much like `npm` in Node, except that `lein` is third party and is not installed when you install a Clojure compiler. Leiningen can be installed through SDKMan. 

To create a new project, run `lein new foobar`, which will create a `foobar` folder containing a set of files and directories. The most important of these is the [[project.clj  | ecosystem.lein.project-clj ]].

You can run `lein help` for the basic man page, and `lein help <subcommand>` for a man page on a given subcommand.
