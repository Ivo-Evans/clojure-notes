`edn` stands for extensible data notation. 

`edn` is a subset of Clojure's syntax in the same way that JSON is a subset of JavaScript syntax. Like JSON, edn is frequently used to express configuration for its language's projects.

Unlike JSON, an edn document is not a single discrete element, but a list or stream of elements. 

Generally speaking edn is Clojure-like. You can find a full spec [here](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).
